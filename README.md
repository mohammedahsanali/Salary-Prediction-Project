# Predictive Payrolls: Unleashing AI Magic for Employee Compensation 🚀💰

Project Purpose -
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the salaries of newly hired employees at TechWorks Consulting. The primary objective is to streamline and improve the process of determining fair and competitive compensation for IT professionals joining the company.

Background -
TechWorks Consulting faces the challenge of efficiently assessing the appropriate salary for a diverse pool of IT talent. The traditional methods for salary determination can be time-consuming and less precise. Therefore, the project explores the application of machine learning techniques to enhance accuracy and efficiency in predicting employee salaries.

Key Steps in the Project -

Data Exploration and Understanding 🕵️‍♂️📊
Analyze the dataset to comprehend its structure, features, and the target variable (salary).
Identify patterns and relationships within the data.

Data Preprocessing 🧹🔄
Clean and transform the data to address missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Ensure the dataset is well-prepared for machine learning modeling.

Data Visualization 📈👁️‍🗨️
Utilize visualizations to gain insights into the distribution of features and their impact on salary predictions.

Feature Selection and Engineering 🔍🔧
Identify key features that contribute significantly to predicting employee salaries. Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.

Model Selection 🤖📊
Evaluate various regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Support Vector Regression.

Model Training and Evaluation 🚂📈
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train selected models and evaluate their performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2).

Final Model Selection 🏆🤖
Choose the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

Documentation 📝📘
Document the entire process, including code, results, and insights.
Model Selection and Performance -
After thorough evaluation, the Random Forest Regression model emerged as the most effective. Its ensemble learning approach, incorporating multiple decision trees, demonstrated strong predictive accuracy.
